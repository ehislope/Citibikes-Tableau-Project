<h1>Tableau-Challenge</h1>

<p>In this challenge, we explored data from <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html">Citibikes</a> in NYC. I specifically looked at the most recent data (Jan-Oct 2020) to look for current ridership info. This lead to a comparison of Spring 2019 and Sprin 2020 data to see the differences in ridership during the Covid-19 pandemic peak in April 2020.</p>

<p>In my first exploration of the 2020 data, I looked at the percentage of riders that were subscribers vs. customers. As expected the largest percentage of riders were subscribers by a large margin. But, when compared to Spring 2019 data, there were actually a larger percentage of customers in Spring 2020. There was also a noticible dip in ridership in April 2020, which was the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic in New York City.</p>

<p>In my comparison of Spring 2019 data vs. Spring 2020 data, there was a huge loss in trips taken over all. Despite the loss in trips taken in Spring 2020 there was in increase in the number of bikes over 2019, as well as, the numbers of stations. </p>
